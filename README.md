Hello other devs!

Simple extension of a coursework assignment i had during my third year of university. An Arcade / retro style game assignment going over the core features of cpp. 

This is my second time using cmake so building the project is easier than my previous repository. However the project will not run for an unknown delete_scalar error.
This is for those wanting to just have a look at the code and maybe the cmake. 
You can find the project on itch.io here 
https://georgethack.itch.io/gamesarcade
fully working however not built with cmake.
